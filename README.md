# SFND-Lidar-Obstacle-Detection
A detection pipeline is applied on a stream Lidar PCD as follows filtering using a voxel grid filter, segmentation using the RANSAC algorithm, clustering using KD-tree data structure and Euclidean clustering, and finally applying bounding boxes on the detected clusters.
